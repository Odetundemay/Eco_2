          Each of us is required annually to certify that we have read,
          understand, and agree to comply with the Rules on Business Ethics
          (RBE).
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraphHeader}>Compliance </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraphTXT}>
          Each of us is responsible for our own compliance with the RBE and all
          other corporate policies, as well as local laws and regulations.
          Supervisors and managers have additional responsibility to help their
          staff understand and apply these values and to maintain an environment
          that promotes consistent compliance.{'\n'} No action that would
          otherwise be precluded by these rules is permissible merely because it
          is customary in a particular location or area of business.{'\n'}
          Employees who do not comply with the RBE may be subject to
          disciplinary action, including termination of employment.

        <Text style={styles.paragraphHeader}>Compliance with Local Law </Text>
        <Text style={styles.paragraphTXT}>
          Ecobank employees and businesses must, at all times, comply with the
          letter and spirit of all relevant laws and regulations.{'\n'}
          Special care must be applied in areas where the law is evolving or
          being extended to situations not previously covered. The company
          should seek to adopt the more conservative position whenever conflict
          arises.{'\n'} If there appears to be a conflict between the RBE and
          local laws and regulations with respect to the interpretation of any
          law or regulation, the legal or compliance officer should be
          consulted.

        <Text style={styles.paragraphTXT}>
          An employee (or another agent) authorized to act on behalf of Ecobank
          who suspects a possible violation of a law, regulation, or the RBE
          should report the suspected violation to his or her supervisor
          promptly. The supervisor should then report to the Compliance Officer
          who will investigate the matter further. Employees are expected to be
          responsible in making allegations, conscious of the fact that such
          allegations can negatively affect the integrity of colleagues.
